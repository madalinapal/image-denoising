# Constrained Optimization for Image Denoising using Total Variation

This project tackles the problem of image denoising by formulating a constrained optimization model aimed at recovering a clean image ùëã, which is as close as possible to the noisy observation ùêºùëö. Instead of relying on traditional denoising techniques such as Gaussian filters, median filters, or deep learning models, this work focuses on a Total Variation (TV)-based approach, known for preserving edges while removing noise.

**Objective Function**
---
We aim to solve the following optimization problem:

Minimize: (1/2) * ||X - Im||_F^2 + Œ≤ * TV(X)

where:
- X is the restored image
- Im is the noisy input image
- ||¬∑||_F is the Frobenius norm
- TV(X) is the total variation of the image

**Methods Implemented**
---
The following optimization algorithms were used to solve the problem:

- Projected Gradient Descent: Implements iterative updates with explicit projection onto constraints.
- ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers): A splitting technique particularly suited for non-smooth problems like TV regularization.
- fmincon: MATLAB‚Äôs built-in constrained optimization solver, used to validate results and compare performance.
